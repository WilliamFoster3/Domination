Step 1: Create UI with all characters
Step 2: Create Character Object, Upgrade Object, Player Object, and Main class
Step 3: Create deck in Player Object, this is an arrayList of Characters there may also have to
be an array list of Upgrades, maybe I can just make it two variables instead
Step 4: attach attack and defense to each character and player. Make sure UI shows this
Step 5: create OnClick methods which control character. After clicking they can click an enemy
character to attack them. I'm unsure of how to do this but it will be figured out
Step 6: method which calculates attack and defense, also need method which can see if a character is dead
Step 7: method which ends turns after clicking a button. A new upgrade is created and a new character
spawns at the beginning of each turn.
Step 8: Attack 2 of the same character to create a taunt character that combines their stats???
Step 9 Balance ideas...
Taunt
give hero attack?
adjust attack and defense of characters and heros respectively?
I don't want hitting face or hitting enemies to be the only strategy.
